# Node-Based Memory System for LLMs

**Author:** Demolari  
**Status:** Conceptual Prototype

## Overview

This project presents a concept for a node-based memory system designed to enhance context retention, information organization, and personalization in large language models (LLMs).

Instead of storing user data or world knowledge as plain text, this system uses a graph of memory nodes—each representing a specific piece of information. The model can traverse these nodes to recall or update knowledge efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Node Memory Graph:** Each memory is a node (e.g., “user likes Warhammer”) with links to related nodes (e.g., “user → likes → books → Warhammer”).
- **Associative Navigation:** The LLM can follow node relationships to retrieve or modify information, mimicking associative thinking.
- **Token Efficiency:** Avoids repeatedly reading full memory logs—relevant data is accessed through node traversal.
- **Persistent Memory:** Enables structured long-term memory across sessions (ideal for AI companions, tutors, etc.).

## Example

```text
User
├── Likes
│   ├── Food: Cupcakes
│   ├── Activities: Walking dog
│   └── Books: Warhammer
└── Personality: Curious, introverted
```

## Real-life usage scenario

Let's say a user often talks about different interests across many conversations. Instead of storing raw chat logs, the nodal system might organize memory like this:

```text
User
├── Preferences
│   ├── Genre: Sci-fi, Fantasy
│   ├── Favorite Authors: Dan Simmons, Frank Herbert
│   ├── Games: Warhammer 40k, Cyberpunk 2077
├── Personality
│   └── Likes deep lore, worldbuilding, philosophical themes
└── Goals
    └── Wants to write a novel titled "Demon Core"
```

### Question:
> "Do you think a story like 'Demon Core' would benefit from a hard sci-fi approach?"

### Traditional LLM:
Reads the entire chat history to recall what "Demon Core" is.

### Nodal memory:
Jumps to `User > Goals > Demon Core`, finds relevant context instantly, and answers more efficiently.


## Benefits

- Faster and cheaper lookups (less token overhead)
- Supports evolving, personalized context
- Memory pruning or priority management is easier
- Useful for conversational agents, game AIs, tutoring systems, and research assistants

## Inspired By

- Biological neural memory networks
- Reinforcement learning agents
- Knowledge graphs & semantic webs
- Cognitive architectures like ACT-R

## 🔖 Nodal Tagging for Contextual Memory

To improve scalability and information retrieval efficiency, this concept can be extended with *tagged nodal memory*. Instead of storing all conversational context as a monolithic block of text, the memory is split into discrete "nodes" — each representing a specific idea, event, or piece of information — enriched with metadata tags.

### Why Tagging?

In long, multi-session interactions, it's inefficient for the model to read or process entire transcripts just to retrieve a specific fact. Instead, the memory system can store nodes like this:

```json
{
  "node_id": "abigail_origin",
  "tags": ["character:Abigail", "location:slums", "event:attack", "relation:father"],
  "source_chat": "2025-03-06",
  "content": "Abigail was born in a Kotori refugee camp. Her mother died in childbirth during a slaver raid..."
}
```

When a user asks:
"What do you know about Abigail's past?"
— the system retrieves only nodes tagged with `character:Abigail` and `event:origin`, skipping unrelated data.

## Benefits

- Precision — Targeted context retrieval without wasting tokens.
- Performance — Faster lookup and response generation in long-term memory.
- Modularity — Nodes can be updated, replaced, or prioritized without rewriting the entire memory.
- Source tracking — Each node can carry references to when and where it was learned (chat IDs, dates).

This approach is especially useful for assistants acting as long-term companions, worldbuilding aides, or narrative trackers for story-based use cases.
